# 📦 PLM Log Analyzer - Distribution Guide

## 🎯 For Samsung Engineering Team Lead

This guide explains how to create and distribute the offline version of PLM Log Analyzer to your team members.

## 🚀 Step 1: Bundle Dependencies (One-time setup)

### Prerequisites
- Machine with internet access
- Python 3.7+ installed
- pip available

### Instructions
1. **Open command prompt/terminal** in the PlmAnalyzer folder
2. **Run the bundler script**:
   ```bash
   python bundle_dependencies.py
   ```
3. **Wait for completion** - this will download all required packages

### What Happens
- Creates `libs/` folder with all dependency files
- Generates `install_dependencies.py` (offline installer)
- Creates `requirements_local.txt` (local requirements)
- Generates comprehensive `README.md`

## 📁 Step 2: Verify Project Structure

After bundling, your folder should contain:
```
PlmAnalyzer/
├── app.py                          # Main application
├── bundle_dependencies.py          # Dependency bundler (one-time use)
├── install_dependencies.py         # Offline dependency installer
├── requirements_local.txt          # Local requirements reference
├── libs/                          # All bundled dependencies (NEW!)
├── templates/                     # HTML templates
├── uploads/                      # Upload folder
├── Launch Offline PLM Analyzer.bat    # Windows launcher
├── Launch Offline PLM Analyzer.ps1    # PowerShell launcher
├── README.md                      # Team instructions
└── DISTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md          # This file
```

## 📦 Step 3: Create Distribution Package

### Option A: Zip Archive (Recommended)
1. **Right-click** on the PlmAnalyzer folder
2. **Select "Send to" → "Compressed (zipped) folder"**
3. **Rename** to: `PLM_Log_Analyzer_Offline_v1.0.zip`

### Option B: Copy to Network Drive
1. **Copy entire folder** to your team's shared network drive
2. **Ensure permissions** allow team members to read/execute

## 👥 Step 4: Distribute to Team Members

### Distribution Methods
- **Email**: Send the zip file (if size allows)
- **Network Drive**: Share folder location
- **USB Drive**: Physical distribution
- **Team Chat**: Upload to your team's communication platform

### Team Member Instructions
